- Used by [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started)
  Imitation back
- Supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) out of the box and makes project installation easy
- Integration [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) Tool for developing UI components
- Used by [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Used by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) TuroRepo part of code management since each component is in a separate repository
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) Error and problem detection: ESLint can detect many errors
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) simplify the formatting process and use a consistent code style across the project.

```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
